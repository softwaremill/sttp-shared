sttp is a family of Scala HTTP-related projects, and currently includes:

* [sttp client](https://github.com/softwaremill/sttp): The Scala HTTP client you always wanted!
* [sttp tapir](https://github.com/softwaremill/tapir): Typed API descRiptions
* [sttp model](https://github.com/softwaremill/sttp-model): Simple Scala HTTP model.
* sttp shared: this project. Shared web socket, FP abstractions, capabilities and streaming code.

## Quickstart with sbt

Add the following dependency:

```scala
"com.softwaremill.sttp.shared" %% "core" % "1.5.0"
```

sttp-shared is available for Scala 2.12, 2.13, 3.3, Scala.JS and Scala Native.

### Building & testing the scala-native version

By default, sttp-native will **not** be included in the aggregate build of the root project. To include it, define the `STTP_NATIVE` environmental variable before running sbt, e.g.:

```
STTP_NATIVE=1 sbt
```

You might need to install some additional libraries, see the [scala native](http://www.scala-native.org/en/latest/user/setup.html) documentation site.
